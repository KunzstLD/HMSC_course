-q1-
  Is it possible to implement the HMSC model in a three-dimensional spatial format with spatial-random effects? This would for example be interresting in marine systems.
-a1-
  GT reffered to "Spatial gaussian processes" but did not explain them further.
  Three spatial dimenons are conceptually similar to spatio-temporal modelling. This is not implemented currently but spatio-temporal random factors are planned for future versions.
-q2-
  Firstly, it was mentioned that positive or negative associations were determined based on random. How was random defined within the model? Curveball, shuffle, etc?
  Second, are these associations maintained during the prediction phase? So if  we project to another region, the spatial associations between species would be the same
  as those measured in the training data?
-a2-
-1-
  Correction: Associations are based on the latent variable part of the model. This does not mean that they are random but rather that they are realizations of a random process.
  (Sound very much like the same thing to me right now, probably bad wording).
  Random variables are random but their covariance is\can be fixed.
-2-
  yes.
-q3-
  As a Stan-user, I started to code up a Stan-version of HMSC some time ago. The fixed part (beta's and influence of traits and phylogeny) is quite straightforward to implement.
  The random part is a bit more complex: especially the latent factor part. I started with the latent factor implementation of Deschamps 2018 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325405531_Fitting_Generalized_Bayesian_Factor_Models_with_stan),
  but got quite a lot of divergent transitions, even without spatiotemporal structure. I didn't put too much effort to improve the code yet, though. Out of curioisity, do you have experience with coding up this part in Stan?
-a3-
  Its not easy. Supplement 3 of "Joint species distribution modelling in R with HMSC" features implementation in STAN. STAN is quite slow (i think this was discussed in some lecture).
-q4-
  is it possible to include spatial information not based on euclidean distance among locations, but for example river-distances. That is, using not isometric distance matrix?
-a4-
  yes.
-q5-
  How to proceedin HMSC when each of the traits of a species are subdivided into several other sub-traits? this is the case with the traits that we study in macroinvertebrates,
  for example. In fact several sub-traits are nested to form a main traits.
  Second, How does HMSC solve redundancy problems between covariates? I am curious to see HMSC take this into account.  I am not able to speak. Thank you
-a5-
  Regarding the first, I think he doesn't quite get the question. Want's to add to list for final discussion on Friday. Later Otso chimed in. Correlated traits should be trated like correlted covariates.
  On this also see q15.
  Regarding the second, like all others. Look beforehand, decide based on subject knowledge.
-q6-
  From my experience running HMSC models, I achieve similar responses using probit and lognormal poisson models to analyse presence\absence and abundance data.
  However, when using abundance conditional on presence (i.e the hurdle model), the results are markedly different from a probit, or lognormal poisson model, often showing
  much weaker correlations between species and covariates, or species-species associations. Why would this be the case? Are we modelling something fundamentally different by
  using the hurdle model?
-a6-
  didn't catch that.
-q7-
  When using a phylogeny (or any phylogenetic correlation matrix), is the relative effect of two species on one another symmetric? I.e. suppose rho = 1, and suppose sister species A and B have a set of betas beta_A and
  beta_B. Will beta_A and beta_B be pulled towards one another with equal strength, or will one species (the one with a stronger fixed effect, higher marginal likelihood, or that occurs more widely) have
  a stronger effect on the other?
  Unrelated: Is it possible to fix any of the model parameters during sampling? For instance if I have independently estimated rho in some prior experiment and want to use that value, can I
  tell Hmsc not to estimate it? Perhaps by providing a non-random prior on that fixed value?
-a7-
  Not sure about answer to first part.
  Yes fixing parameters in possible in the sampleMCMC function.
-q8-
  Is the phylogenetic signal pooled across species? Or are they pair-wise specific? Because there may be some closely related species whose niche may be more
  different than observed across the entire dataset
-a8-
  From what I understood, pooled across species. Implementing the other thing would be hard.
-q8-
  When runnning Hmsc in parallel, verbose does not work. Is there a way to follow the progress of the different chains?
-a8-
  No
-q9-
  (question via voice chat) Why did you implement your own Gibbs Samples?
-a9-
  Curiosity, better and deeper understanding of the own model/ method
-q10-
  What were the criteria for using r for HMSC?
-a10-
    Heavily used by ecologists. Started out in MatLab. Some new developments in Python+Tensorflow. Julia interesting but not many libraries yet, also relatively small userbase.
-q11-
    Is it also possible to model variance of response (not only a mean)? Link to brms package vignette added to question: https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/articles/brms_distreg.html
-a11-
    Had a paper on that (Tikhonov et al. 2017 MEE). There can be extensions but no research done yet on performance (? not sure that's what he ment). Calls it non-stationary covariance models.
-q12-
    Does HMSC have to be faster if you compute on a GPU?
-a12-
    Depends on GPU. Not his expertise. GPU support will probably be implementd at sometime in the future.
-q13-
    As the covariances with phylogeny etc is it impossible to split up the likelihood calculation into partial sums? i.e. can you only parallelise individual calculations (like inversions)
    “calculations” probably isn’t a very useful word there
-a13-
   ???
-q14-
    How do we deal with data with prior distributions not covered by HMSC? For example exponential distribution for a trait (e.g. time to reproduction) or beta distribution for probability of occurrence data?
-a14-
    What do you mean by distribution for traits? Because currently traits are fixed. Regarding the data observation models, currently HMSC is constrained to those where data optimizations are available.
    This is one of the main reasons they currently look into other ways to fit their model.
-q15-
    In many HMSC analyses, land cover is used as covariate(s), e.g. fraction of woodland, agricultural land etc..
    These are compositional: the different cover classes sum to 100%. This might induce spurious correlations, which
    might influence inference (not predictions). I might've missed it in the book or this week, but do you now of a
    convenient approach to deal with this problem?
-a15-
    Drop variables or do a PCA. If you have variables that sum to one, this can lead to indeterminancy or at least Hauck Donner Effect.
